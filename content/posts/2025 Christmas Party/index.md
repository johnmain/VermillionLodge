The Holiday season has officially arrived in Dauphin!

On the evening of November 28th, members, friends, and families of Vermillion Lodge #68 gathered to enjoy the magic of the annual **Dauphin Parade of Lights**. It was wonderful to see our community come together under the winter stars to celebrate the spirit of the season.

Following the parade, the warmth continued back at the Lodge. We enjoyed a hearty, festive meal together, sharing stories and laughter. The highlight of the night was the fellowship found in our family games, where brothers and their loved ones competed in good spirits—a true reminder that the strength of our Lodge is found in the families that support us.

As we look toward the remainder of the year, we wish all our Brethren and the entire Dauphin community a very Merry Christmas and a season filled with peace and harmony.

**Happy Holidays from the Worshipful Master, Officers, and Brethren of Vermillion Lodge #68!**
