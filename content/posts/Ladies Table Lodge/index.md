Vermillion Lodge No. 68 hosted a memorable Ladies’ Table Lodge, celebrating fellowship, tradition, and gratitude. The evening was guided by R.W. Bro. Rick Laronde, who served as Master of Ceremonies, ensuring a warm and engaging atmosphere throughout the event.

The Lodge was honoured by the presence of M.W. Bro. Rey Galapon, Grand Master, and R.W. Bro. Gord Greasley, Deputy Grand Master, whose attendance added distinction to the occasion.

The evening was shared by the Brethren and Wives of Vermillion Lodge, together with cherished guests and the Widows of our departed Brothers, who continue to hold a special place in the heart of the Lodge and its traditions. The event reflected the true spirit of Masonry—unity, respect, and appreciation for the ladies who support and strengthen the Craft.
