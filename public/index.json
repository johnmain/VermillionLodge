Its members share a common goal of helping each other become better men. Its body of knowledge and system of ethics is based on the belief that each man has a responsibility to improve himself while being devoted to his family, faith, country, and fraternity.\nIts roots go back centuries and its members are diverse: high profile leaders, physicians, construction workers, farmers…and maybe you.\nAncient…and modern. #We’re united by three ancient and fundamental principles—brotherly love, charity and truth—that are made relevant to the 21st century through the personal development, good works and social connections available to our members in the 550+ lodges across Ontario.\nGreat benefits…for you and the world. #Freemasonry offers much to its members—the opportunity to grow, the chance to make a difference and the means to build a better world for our children. It offers the chance to socialize and work with men who have the same values and ideals.\nWe strengthen and improve our character by learning and practicing basic virtues of fraternal love, charity, and truth. Our principles extend far beyond our interactions with each other, and we strive to apply them to our daily lives.\nAnd there’s so much more. #It\u0026rsquo;s easy to learn about Masons—starting with the pages of this website.
